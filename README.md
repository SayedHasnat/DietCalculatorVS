Porting existing .net apps to iOS &amp; Android using Xamarin & Visual Studio

Here's the sample that's being ported: [Exploring the Model View Controller Patterin in Silverlight](http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Exploring-the-Model-View-Controller-MVC-pattern.aspx)

This port uses file-linking for referencing commonly used files across iOS, Android and Silverlight projects.

There are two solution files included:

* DietCalculatorVS.sln - opens in Visual Studio, includes the source Silverlight app for reference

* DietCalculatorXS.sln - opens in Xamarin Studio, does not include the 'source' Silverlight app
